### About this HW ### 
This homework assignment proved to be a challenging one for me, since I am not the best at using css and styling with bootstrap. But it helped me reinforce my knowledge about posistioning in CSS, and the use of boxes has also helped me learn more about relative vs absolute posistioning. I am sure enough that my pages aren't responsive to layout changes that the user will do, and the use of media queries was suppose to be minimized. But applying the knowledge that I learned from class about the grid system and Boostrap components made creating this assignment a lot easier than I expected

### HW Layout ##
I created a folder called UNC_Bootcamp_HW_2 and inside the folder are the contents for each page I was suppose to create alongside each of there own CSS style sheets, I have also added an assets folder that contains personalized images of mine that I used for my site.
