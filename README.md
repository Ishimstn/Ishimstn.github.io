### UNC Bootcamp HW_3 README ###

### Objectives:
User Story wants an employee to be able to generate a random password based on certain criteria Creating a strong Password to provide greater security

### What I learned
I was able to implement and create my own javascript file to create the core structure of the criteria and requirments of the password length and characters based on user input. I found some complications with at least making things work properly in the script.js file. I was able to use Chrome Dev tools to indicate the problems that I was facing in order to fix them and reupload my code to make the application work.
