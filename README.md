### Learning Objectives ###
This assingment tested my ability to properly use CSS styling and Bootstrap Components to create a responsive portofolio page for employers to see who I am, although this is the only second week of work, I enjoyed being able to create my own personal website for tech companies to see my work and my progress. I had a difficult time adjusting with the use of Bootstrap and being able to position the nav bar on each page. I was able to properly learn and reinforce my knowledge of using posistion relative vs absolute to posistion my pictures and content correctly. 

### What's Inside ### 
This repo contains the contents for HW assignment number 2, in which I created three distinct html files respectively called index.html, Portfolio.html, and contact.html. Each html file has there own CSS Styling Sheets that correlate with each file. I have also created an assets folder in which I stored my personal images (JPG) of me for my bio and portfolio link.
